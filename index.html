    <h1>BIRTHDAYS</h1>
    <p>
        Ghanaian names (or personal names in Ghana) consist of several given names and surnames based on the language of ethnic groups in Ghana
        Frequently,children are given a "day name" which corresponds to the day in the week when they were born.
        These day names have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.
        Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an Arabic or western name.
        Here are some of the examples.
